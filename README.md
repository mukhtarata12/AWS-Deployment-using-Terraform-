**Explanation behind the code**

- AWS Provider Configuration (provider "aws"): Specifies the AWS region (us-east-1) where resources will be provisioned.

- VPC (aws_vpc.main): Defines a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16, enabling DNS support and hostnames.

- Internet Gateway (aws_internet_gateway.gw): Attaches an internet gateway to the VPC (aws_vpc.main) for internet connectivity.

- Subnet (aws_subnet.public_subnet): Creates a public subnet (10.0.1.0/24) within the VPC in availability zone us-east-1a.

- Security Group (aws_security_group.web_sg): Defines a security group (WebSecurityGroup) allowing inbound HTTP traffic (port 80) from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0) and all outbound traffic.

- EC2 Instance (aws_instance.web_server): Launches an Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance (t2.micro) in the public_subnet subnet, associated with the WebSecurityGroup security group and using a specified key pair (your_key_pair_name) for SSH access.

- RDS MySQL Database (aws_db_instance.my_database): Creates a MySQL RDS database instance (db.t2.micro) named mydatabase, accessible only within the VPC, with an admin username (admin) and specified password (your_password).

- Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) (aws_elb.web_elb): Creates a load balancer named web-elb that balances HTTP traffic on port 80 across instances in the WebSecurityGroup security group within the public_subnet subnet. It performs health checks every 30 seconds and routes traffic based on HTTP health checks.

**Deployment Steps**

Initialize Terraform:

Navigate to the directory containing main.tf.
Run terraform init to initialize Terraform and download necessary plugins.
Review and Apply Changes:

Run terraform plan to review the execution plan and verify the changes that will be made.
If satisfied, run terraform apply and confirm by typing yes when prompted to apply the changes and deploy AWS resources.
Monitor Deployment:

Terraform will provision the defined AWS resources (VPC, Subnet, EC2 Instance, RDS Database, ELB) based on the configuration in main.tf.
Monitor the terminal for progress updates and any error messages during resource creation.
Accessing Resources:

After successful deployment, Terraform will output information such as the EC2 instance's public IP (web_instance), RDS database endpoint (rds_endpoint), and ELB DNS name (elb_dns_name).
Use these outputs to access and manage your deployed resources via AWS Management Console or programmatically.
Cleanup (Optional):

If no longer needed, run terraform destroy to delete all provisioned resources. Confirm with yes when prompted to proceed.
